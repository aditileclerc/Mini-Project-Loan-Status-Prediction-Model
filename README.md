# Loan Status Prediction Model
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to predict the loan approval status based on user-provided data. The project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification algorithms.

**Project Overview**

The Loan Status Prediction Model uses historical loan application data to predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved. The project aims to:

- Provide an end-to-end machine learning workflow.
- Analyze and preprocess raw loan data for better model performance.
- Implement and compare various classification models.
  
**Features**
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into trends and correlations in the dataset.
- Model Training: Use of machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
